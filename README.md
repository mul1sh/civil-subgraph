## Civil Subgraph

This subgraph indexes the [civil registry](https://registry.civil.co) and allows users to get snapshot from the registry at a given point in time. 

From this snapshot I was able to built the above dashboard which gives users and interactive way of knowing the key indicators of the registry at different points at time.
